My name is Franck Cuny and this is my little corner on the web.

I currently work as a [Site Reliability Engineer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Site_reliability_engineering) (SRE) at [Roblox](https://www.roblox.com). Previously, I worked as a SRE at [Twitter](https://twitter.com/TwitterEng), and my focus was on infrastructure.

I'm interested in building sustainable teams, improving the management and operation of large infrastructure, and to work with different teams to implement best practices around reliability and security.
