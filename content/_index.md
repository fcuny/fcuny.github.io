ðŸ‘‹ My name is Franck Cuny and this is my little corner on the web.

I'm a Technical Director at [Roblox](https://www.roblox.com), where I'm focusing on Reliability. Previously, I worked at [Twitter](https://twitter.com/TwitterEng) for close to 8 years, where I was a Sr Staff Site Reliability Engineer. My focus is on Platform and Compute infrastructure.

The simplest way to contact me is via <a href="mailto:franck@fcuny.net">email</a>.
