January 7th 2022 was my last day at Twitter, after more than 7 years at the company.

The first few years I worked as an SRE in the core-storage team, with the PUB/SUB and key-value store teams.

I spend the last four years working with the Compute team, both maintaining and operating our (very large) Aurora/Mesos clusters, and also working on the adoption of kubernetes, both for our data centers and for the cloud. Working with Compute was extremely fulfilling to me, as I worked closely with our hardware engineering and kernel/operating system teams.

During these 7 years, I was constantly pushed by my coworkers to grow, to step up to new challenges, and I learned a tremendous amount about running large scale distributed systems. I'm extremely glad for that experience, it was by far the most interesting and challenging job I've ever had so far.
