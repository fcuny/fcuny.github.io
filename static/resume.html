      Initially the Tech Lead of a team of 6 SREs supporting the Compute
      infrastructure. In August 2021 I changed to be a Software Engineer and was
      leading one of the effort to adopt Kubernetes for our on-premise
      infrastructure. As a Tech Lead I helped define number of internal
      processes for the team, from on-call rotations to postmortem processes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Twitter&#39;s Compute is one of the largest Mesos cluster in the world
      (XXX thousands of nodes across multiple data centers). The team defined
      KPIs, improved automation to mange the large fleet of bare metal machines,
      defined APIs for maintenance with partner teams.
    </p>
    <p>
      In addition to supporting Aurora/Mesos, I also lead a number of effort
      related to Kubernetes, both on-premise and in the cloud.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally, I&#39;ve helped Twitter save XX of millions of dollar in hardware
      by designing and implementing strategies to significantly improve the
      hardware utilization of our bare metal infrastructure.

    <p>
      For 4 years I supported the Messaging and Manhattan teams. I moved all the
      pub-sub systems from bare-metal deployment to Aurora/Mesos, being the
      first storage team to adopt the Compute orchestration platform. This
      helped reducing operations, time to deploy, and improve overall
      reliability. I pushed for adopting 10Gb+ networking in our data center to
      help our team to scale. I was the SRE Tech Lead for the Manhattan team,
      helping with performance, operation and automation.

      During my time at Say Media, I worked on two different teams. I started as
      a software engineer in the platform team building the various APIs; I then
      transitioned to the operation team, to develop tooling to increase the
      effectiveness of the engineering organization.

      I was one of the early engineers joining Linkfluence in 2007. I led the
      development of the company&#39;s crawler (web, feeds). I was responsible
      for defining the early architecture of the company, and designed the
      internal platforms (Service Oriented Architecture). I helped the company
      to contribute to open source projects; contributed to open source projects
      on behalf of the company; represented the company at numerous open sources
      conferences in Europe.
